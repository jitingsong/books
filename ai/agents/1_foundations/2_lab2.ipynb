Add print statements to understand what's going on, and then come up with your own variations.<br/><br/>If you have time, I'd love it if you submit a PR for changes in the community_contributions folder - instructions in the resources.

      "['Below is a concise, actionable 10-year coastal resilience strategy tailored to a 120,000-resident coastal city with a $25M annual operating budget, 20% poverty, a 10 km coastline, frequent high-risk events, and the political/operational constraints you described. All figures are order-of-magnitude estimates intended to guide planning, with explicit assumptions and calculations shown at the end. Interventions are prioritized to protect lives and critical services first, advance equity, and remain politically feasible by balancing near-term gains with voluntary, phased actions.\\n\\nAssumptions (key starting points used in calculations)\\n- Sea-level rise scenario: 0.5–1.2 m by 2100; near-term risk rising gradually; three “100-year” storms in 15 years indicates high annual hazard and clustered event risk.\\n- Baseline risk (current conditions): annualized expected loss (AEL) from coastal hazards approximated at $7.5M/year citywide (damages, business interruption, and service outages); probability of a critical service failure during a major storm ≈ 22% per major storm event.\\n- Critical-infrastructure exposure: water treatment plant, hospital, and power substation currently in today’s 1-in-100-year floodplain; thus high leverage to harden or relocate.\\n- Budget constraints: initial one-time resilience fund = $50M; ability to reallocate up to 10% of the annual operating budget = $2.5M/year (for 10 years).\\n- Equity focus: 20% of households in poverty; low-income neighborhoods disproportionately exposed; resilience plan should directly benefit these communities (e.g., through protection of essential services, housing moves that avoid displacement, subsidized insurance, and community engagement).\\n- Political feasibility: avoid mass relocation mandates; emphasize voluntary, phased relocation paired with path-dependent protections (hardening, natural defenses, better planning) and transparent engagement.\\n\\nA. Interventions: concise descriptions, costs, risk reductions, risks, data needs, and monitoring metrics\\n1) Intervention A — Critical Infrastructure Floodproofing and Redundancy (floodproof, elevate, and harden water, hospital, and power substation; plus backup power and redundancies)\\n- a) One-sentence description: Harden and floodproof the city’s three critical facilities, with elevated or watertight equipment rooms, flood barriers, and reliable back-up power to ensure essential services operate through a major flood.\\n- b) 10-year cost and allocations:\\n  - Initial from $50M: $12.0M\\n  - Annual budget reallocation: $0.60M/year for 6 years (total $3.6M)\\n  - Total 10-year cost: $15.6M\\n  - Allocation mix: 12.0 + 3.6 = 15.6; distributed within the 6-year window after Year 0\\n- c) Approximate risk reductions:\\n  - Expected annualized loss (AEL) reduction: from $7.5M to ≈ $4.5M (≈ 40% reduction; saves about $3.0M per year)\\n  - Reduction in probability of critical service failure during a major storm: from 22% to ≈ 11% (≈ 50% relative reduction)\\n- d) Key risks/trade-offs: high upfront capital needs; potential construction disruption during execution; requires long-term maintenance; performance depends on design to meet uncertainty of flood depths; avoids relocation but could be overwhelmed by extreme events beyond design specs.\\n- e) Three highest-value data points to collect first:\\n  - Facility-specific flood depth and duration exposure (methods: hydrodynamic/flood-model simulations; timeframe: 0–12 months; cost: ~$0.3M)\\n  - Reliability and redundancy assessments for backup power and critical equipment (methods: outage and maintenance data, red/green-zone drills; timeframe: 6–12 months; cost: ~$0.15M)\\n  - Post-construction performance testing under staged flood scenarios (methods: shop/field tests, independent peer review; timeframe: 6–12 months; cost: ~$0.15M)\\n- f) Monitoring metrics and pivot triggers:\\n  - Metric 1: AEL attributable to critical infra after project completion; threshold to trigger pivot: if AEL reduction < 28% within 6 years, reassess design/scope\\n  - Metric 2: Probability of critical service failure during a modeled major storm; threshold: fail rate > 12% after 7 years; if so, re-evaluate protection levels or add additional redundancies\\n\\n2) Intervention B — Evacuation Planning and Public Alert System (enhanced evacuation routes, shelters, automated warnings)\\n- a) One-sentence description: Develop scalable, equity-focused evacuation plans with staged routes, clearly identified shelters, and robust, timely public alert and information systems.\\n- b) 10-year cost and allocations:\\n  - Initial: $4.0M\\n  - Annual reallocations: $0.30M/year for 10 years\\n  - Total 10-year cost: $7.0M\\n  - Allocation mix: initial 4.0; ongoing 3.0 over 10 years\\n- c) Risk reductions:\\n  - AEL reduction: ≈ $0.7–$0.9M/year (≈ 9–12% reduction)\\n  - Probability of critical service failure: minor direct effect on service facilities, but substantial indirect effect by reducing casualties and demand shock; modeled reduction ≈ 2–4 percentage points\\n- d) Risks/trade-offs: requires sustained public trust; must reach and be usable by low-literacy and non-English-speaking residents; shelters must be flood-safe and accessible; ongoing maintenance costs\\n- e) Data points to collect:\\n  - Evacuation time and shelter capacity utilization (methods: tabletop and full-scale drills; timeframe: 12–18 months; cost: ~$0.2M)\\n  - Population at risk and travel-time to shelters, by neighborhood (methods: GIS analysis, household surveys; timeframe: 6–12 months; cost: ~$0.15M)\\n  - Messaging effectiveness and accessibility (methods: social-media analytics, multilingual communications testing; timeframe: 6–12 months; cost: ~$0.05M)\\n- f) Monitoring metrics:\\n  - Metric 1: Time to evacuate critical neighborhoods to safety; threshold: average evacuation time > 2x target; trigger within 2–3 years\\n  - Metric 2: Shelter occupancy rate and shelter access equity (share of vulnerable populations served); threshold: <90% target occupancy in key districts; trigger if <80% consistently for two drills\\n\\n3) Intervention C — Managed Relocation and Phased Relocation (voluntary buyouts for the highest-risk areas; phased relocation with affordable replacement housing)\\n- a) One-sentence description: Implement voluntary, phased relocation for the most flood-vulnerable residences and public facilities, prioritizing low-income areas, with buyouts and replacement housing in safer locations.\\n- b) 10-year cost and allocations:\\n  - Initial: $7.0M\\n  - Annual reallocations: $0.40M/year for 5 years\\n  - Total 10-year cost: $9.0M\\n  - Allocation mix: initial 7.0; ongoing 2.0\\n- c) Risk reductions:\\n  - AEL reduction: ~ $1.0–$2.0M/year (13–27%), depending on how many structures are relocated\\n  - Probability of critical service failure: reduction of 5–10 percentage points in high-risk corridors; overall system risk reduces as critical facilities are moved farther from exposure\\n- d) Risks/trade-offs: political sensitivity; potential displacement concerns; requires fair buyout pricing, affordable replacement housing, and strong housing market stabilization; must ensure social equity and adequate transition services\\n- e) Data points to collect:\\n  - Property exposure and buyout feasibility in target zones (methods: parcel-level risk mapping; timeframe: 9–12 months; cost: ~$0.25M)\\n  - Replacement housing supply and affordability analysis (methods: market analysis and developer partnerships; timeframe: 12–24 months; cost: ~$0.15M)\\n  - Community acceptance and relocation willingness surveys (methods: random-sample surveys;
